# Portfolio
Collection of projects. They exists in code/unity form so will most likely not run due to githubs conversion of unity projects.
Due to size limitations on the projects, and potential copyright issues,
The graphics of the unity projects have been removed. This most likely would also mean that the project will contain many errors upon startup and wont be able to run.
If you would like a version containing models and grafics for a more complete overview of the project please contact me :)
